CVPR@Paris 2025 is a 1-day event that takes place at Sorbonne Université on the 6<sup>th</sup> of May 2025. This event provides a local alternative to the <a href="https://cvpr.thecvf.com/">CVPR conference</a>. It aims at addressing some sustainability and inclusivity concerns in Deep Learning and Computer vision research. All students and researchers are welcome to attend.

Authors of all accepted papers at CVPR 2025 are given the opportunity to present their work, through an oral presentation and/or a poster session. We unfortunately cannot accomodate oral presentations for all accepted papers; a subset of accepted papers will be proposed an oral presentation, based on scientific quality, thematic coherence and diversity criteria.

<!-- **New this year:** we offer travel grants. Please let us know when registering if you want to apply for a travel grant. Grants will be given in priority to students and members of underrepresented groups in ML. Please note that we will not fund air travel, for sustainability reasons. -->

## Registration

The event is free but registration is mandatory. Registration TBA.

<!-- This event is in-person only: we will neither record presentations nor include online options. -->

## Venue

This event will take place at Campus Jussieu (4 Place Jussieu, Paris 5ème).

To access by metro, go to station Jussieu on the line 10.

<!-- The presentations will be held in amphithéâtre 25. All social events (poster sessions, mentor and career sessions, cocktail and lunch) will be held in SCAI and in the Esclangon building, which is located within Jussieu. A map of Jussieu is available <a href="docs/assets/plan_neurips2022v2.jpg"> here</a>. -->

## Sustainability ambitions

We aim to organize a local and sustainable alternative to in-person attendance to international ML conferences. To this aim:

- we strongly encourage participants to NeurIPS@Paris to travel to Paris by sustainable means.
- we offer fully vegeterian catering.
- we encourage participants to consider as much as possible not flying to the main NeurIPS conference. -->
